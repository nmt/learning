## About
I have so many questions about tech, about life. Here is where I find out answers to those questions.


## Questions

### What happens when you type in a URL and hit enter in your browser?

### How do URLs work?
Someone linked their website ("Go to example-website.com!") but people had reported that it only worked when you prepended the address with `www.`. I imagine this has something to do with the CNAME?

### What are some good beginner front end resources?

### How does `async/await` work?
- [JavaScript Visualized: Promises & Async/Await](https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-promises-async-await-5gke)

### Does ['sleep sort'](https://www.facebook.com/ooteensmemes/posts/2793735160889541) work in practice?
![Screenshot of code that uses setTimeout() to print numbers in an array. The output lists the numbers in increasing order.](img/sleep-sort.png)
- Loek Janssen: "This does not guarantee the correct sorted result. In javascript runtimes the setTimeout callbacks are added to the event loop and executed if it takes precedence to other items waiting to be executed. Hypothetically, the setTimeout callbacks can be displayed to stdout in a different order."

### How does Docker work and what are some use cases?
